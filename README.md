## Introduction

Welcome to the Waste Classifier project, a cutting-edge fix intended to support environmentally friendly recycling methods. By utilizing computer vision and machine learning, our Waste Classifier seeks to address the ever-increasing challenge of waste management by providing effective and intelligent methods.
I have created this project by taking reference from Murtaza's CVZONE tutorials.
